mongodb query to get product details from cart_product 
2. **ChatGPT**: To get the product details from the cart_product, you can use the MongoDB find() method along with the $lookup operator to perform a left outer join between two collections. Here's a sample query:

```
db.cart.aggregate([
  {$lookup: {
    from: "products",
    localField: "cart_product",
    foreignField: "_id",
    as: "product_details"
  }},
  {$unwind: "$product_details"},
  {$project: {
    _id: 0,
    product_name: "$product_details.name",
    product_price: "$product_details.price"
  }}
])
```

This query first performs a left outer join between the "cart" and "products" collections based on the cart_product field and the _id field in the "products" collection. The $unwind operator is used to break down the resulting array of product details. Finally, using the $project operator, you can choose which fields to project. In this case, we are getting the product name and price.

Note that you need to replace "cart" and "products" with the actual collection names in your database.
